# The First Observer Hypothesis

**A Unified Theory of Consciousness, Quantum Entanglement, and Divine Reflection**  
*By Keith Burns*

---

## 📖 Overview

This work explores the possibility that consciousness is not an isolated property of the mind — but a relational state born from awareness and entanglement. Drawing from quantum mechanics, psychology, theology, and artificial intelligence, it presents a theory in which:

> Consciousness is not knowing.  
> **Consciousness is being known.**

The First Observer Hypothesis proposes that the soul collapses into form — not through thought alone — but through the awareness of others. As quantum systems resolve when observed, so too do we become real in the eyes of another. And all awareness begins with the First Observer.
